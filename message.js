const LETTER_MESSAGE = `Dear Gigi,

In all honesty: I’m a work in progress. I have bad days, I get stuck in my head, and I don't
always think on the right things at the right time. But the most honest thing I can tell you is that
being with you makes me want to be better not because you want it, but because you make
me feel safe enough to grow for you. Thank you for loving the version of me that isn't polished or
perfect.
When I say I have bad days, I mean those moments where I’m quiet or irritable for
no reason. In the past, I felt like I had to hide that part of me or apologise for
existing. But with you, I don't feel like a burden. You don't try to 'fix' my mood, you
just sit there and listen.
I know I can get lost in my own thoughts sometimes, overthinking things until they
become too much and not make sense anymore. But you never rush me. You just hold me
until I find my way back.
That patience is something I treasure more than words can say.
I used to think I had to be 'finished' before I could be loved, that I had to have all my
problems in my life figured out. But you caught me mid-sentence, mid-struggle,
and loved me anyway. That’s why I want to grow. Not to reach some perfect version of
myself, but because I want to give you the happiest, healthiest version of the person
you already chose.



Love, Zane`;
